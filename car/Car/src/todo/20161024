-wasted three days with study stacktrace of not running 'lerprogramm' and by the way lose my mind
-if it is a weakness of the IDE i am so quit with NetBeans
-going on with tutorials, read more stuff, and find a little distance between me and the IDE and a complete senseless e.stacktrace
-next step maybe should be to find another friendly IDE wich is not gonna mess me up!
